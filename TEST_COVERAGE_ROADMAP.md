# Test Coverage Roadmap

## Current Status: ðŸŸ¡ Building Coverage (10-15%)

This document outlines our plan to gradually improve test coverage as the project matures.

## Coverage Milestones

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
**Target: 10% coverage**
- Basic import tests
- Syntax validation
- Core function signatures
- CI/CD pipeline setup

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Core Functionality (v1.1)
**Target: 20% coverage**
- Mock external API calls
- Test environment configuration
- Basic error handling tests
- Model selection logic

### ðŸ“ˆ Phase 3: Integration (v1.2)
**Target: 40% coverage**
- Slack event handler tests
- CLI input/output tests
- Conversation history management
- Model switching functionality

### ðŸš€ Phase 4: Comprehensive (v2.0)
**Target: 60% coverage**
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Error recovery scenarios
- Multi-threaded conversation tests

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (Priority 1)
- [ ] `get_model_response()` function
- [ ] Environment variable loading
- [ ] Model ID validation
- [ ] Message formatting

### Integration Tests (Priority 2)
- [ ] Slack bot event handlers
- [ ] OpenAI client initialization
- [ ] API error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting

### End-to-End Tests (Priority 3)
- [ ] Complete conversation flow
- [ ] Model switching during conversation
- [ ] Multi-user scenarios
- [ ] Long conversation handling

## How to Contribute

1. Pick a test category from above
2. Write tests following existing patterns in `tests/`
3. Update coverage percentage in GitHub Actions when milestones are reached
4. Mark completed items in this document

## Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_chat_cli_openai.py -v

# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Coverage Guidelines

- New features should include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for 80% coverage on new code
- Mock external services (Slack, OpenAI, Databricks)
- Test both success and failure paths

## Technical Debt

Current issues to address:
- Tests making real API calls (need mocking)
- Missing environment variable validation tests
- No performance benchmarks
- Limited error scenario coverage

## Timeline

- **Q4 2024**: Reach 20% coverage
- **Q1 2025**: Reach 40% coverage
- **Q2 2025**: Reach 60% coverage
- **Q3 2025**: Maintain 60%+ with new features
